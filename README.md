# dnstrace

This tool performs a DNS resolution by tracing the delegation path from the root name servers, and by following the CNAME chain. Each query is reported with statistics about all delegated name servers.

## Features

* Follow CNAMEs
* Query all name servers in parallel and report stats for each
* Report about non glued name server lookup time
* Enable DNSSEC query option to better emulate name server queries
* Compute the cold best path as if the resolver started with an empty cache to recurse queried name
